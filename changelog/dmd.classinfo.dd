Added .nameSig field to TypeInfo_Class in object.d

This is a 16 byte md5 signature of the fully qualified name of the class.
It is used to compare two classes for equality, rather than comparing the
pointers with a fallback to doing a string compare on the name, which can
be rather slow.

The result is both druntime and phobos will need to be recompiled to be
compatible with this change. Any libraries will need to be recompiled
as well.
